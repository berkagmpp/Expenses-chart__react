<a href="#"><img width="10%" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-005FED?style=flat-square&logo=React&logoColor=white"/></a>

### What I Applied
- useState from react (Expenses.js, ExpenseForm.js, NewExpense.js, App.js)
- Stateful List (App.js)
- Reusable wrapper component(UI) with props.children (Card.js)
- Child-to-Parent component (Bottom-up) (NewExpense.js - ExpenseForm.js)

### Key Function
- Press the ADD NEW EXPENSE button to display a form for entering the new expense's Title, Amount and Date.
- Click the CANCEL button on the ADD NEW EXPENSE form to close the form.
- After filling out the input box in the ADD NEW EXPENSE form and pressing the ADD EXPANSE button, the data is stored in the corresponded year.
- After selecting a year in the right corner, the expenses for that year are listed in the bottom chart. 
- In addition, the monthly expenses ratio is expressed by assuming that the month with the highest expenses for the year is 100%.
